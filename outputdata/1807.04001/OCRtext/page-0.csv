"Abstract. We propose a novel end-to—end neural network architecture
that, once trained, directly outputs a probabilistic clustering of a batch of
input examples in one pass. It estimates a distribution over the number of
clusters k, and for each 1 S k S kmax, a distribution over the individual
cluster assignment for each data point. The network is trained in advance
in a supervised fashion on separate data to learn grouping by any percep-
tual similarity criterion based on pairwise labels (same / different group).
It can then be applied to different data containing different groups. We
demonstrate promising performance on high-dimensional data like images
(COIL-100) and speech (TIMIT). We call this “learning to cluster” and
show its conceptual difference to deep metric learning, semi-supervise
clustering and other related approaches while having the advantage of
performing learnable clustering fully end-to—end."

Introduction

"Consider the illustrative task of grouping images of cats and dogs by perceived
similarity: depending on the intention of the user behind the task, the similarity
could be deﬁned by animal type (foreground object), environmental nativeness
(background landscape, cp. Fig. 1) etc. This is characteristic of clustering percep-
tual, high-dimensional data like images [15] or sound [24]: a user typically has
some similarity criterion in mind when thinking about naturally arising groups
(e.g., pictures by holiday destination, or persons appearing; songs by mood, or
use of solo instrument). As deﬁning such a similarity for every case is difﬁcult, it
is desirable to learn it. At the same time, the learned model will in many cases
not be a classiﬁer—the task will not be solved by classiﬁcation—since the number
and speciﬁc type of groups present at application time are not known in advance
(e.g., speakers in TV recordings; persons in front of a surveillance camera; object
types in the picture gallery of a large web shop)."
