X2-Divergence Based Inequalities

"Lemma C.1. Let S be a random variable over the domain 8. Let 7r and 7r’ be two policies and and
A ~ 7r(- | S) andA’ ~ 7r’(- | S). LetY ~  | S,A) andY’ ~  | S,A’) be the random
variables for the next states under two policies. Then,"

(0.1)
"Proof. By deﬁnition, we have that Y|S = s, A = a has the same density as Y’ |S = s, A’ = a for
any a and 3. Therefore by Theorem D.4 (setting X, X’, Y, Y’ in Theorem D.4 by A|S = s, A’ |S = s,
Y|S = 3, Y’ |S = s respectively), we have"
X2(Y|S= s,Y'|s= s) s X2(A|S = s,A'|s= s)
(0.2)
Taking expectation over the randomness of S we complete the proof.

Properties of Markov Processes
"In this subsection, we consider bounded the difference of the distributions induced by two markov
process starting from the same initial distributions ii. Let P, P’ be two transition kern_e1s. Let
G = 2,:0 *ykPk and G = (1 — *y)G. Deﬁne G’ and G’ similarly. Therefore we have that GM is the
discounted distribution of states Visited by the markov process starting from distribution p. In other

words, if u is the distribution of So, and P is the transition kernel induced by some policy 7r, then
GM = p”."
First of all, let A = 7(P’ — P) and we note that with simple algebraic manipulation,

"Let f be some function. We will mostly interested in the difference between ESNGM [f] and

1E SNG, M [f], which can be rewritten as ((G’ — G) u, f We will bound this quantity from above by
some divergence measure between P’ and P."
"We start off with a simple lemma that controls the form (p — q, f 2 by the X2 divergence between p
and q. With this lemma vge can reduce our problem of bounding ((G’ — G) u, f) to characterizing the
X2 divergence between G’u and GM.

Lemma C.2. Let p and q be probability distributions. Then we have"

Proof. By Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, we have


"The following Lemma is a reﬁnement of the lemma above. It deals with the distributions p and q
with the special structure p = WP’ ,le and q = WPM.

Lemma C.3. Let W, P’, P be transition kernels and ,le be a distribution. Then,
<W(P’ — PM, f)2 : xi(P’, PXWP/J, f2) (0.4)"

"where 2 P’, P is a divergence between transitions deﬁned in Deﬁnition D.3.

"Proof. By Lemma C.2 with p = WPM and q = WP’ u, we conclude that

"By Theorem D4 and Theorem D.5 we have that X2(WPIIU,, WP/J) g X2(P’p, PM) 3 xi(P’, P),
plugging this into the equation above we complete the proof. El"
