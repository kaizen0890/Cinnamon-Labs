"The following Lemma is a stronger extension of Lemma C.4, which can be used to future improve
Proposition 4.6, and may be of other potential independent interests. We state it for completeness.

Proof. We ﬁrst use induction to prove that:
"(C. 12)
By Lemma C.4, we got the case for K = 1. Assuming we have prove the case for K, then applying

By Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, we obtain that

Plugging the equation above into equation (C.12), we provide the induction hypothesis for the case
with K + 1.

Now applying (GIA(GP)KG/J,, f2K)2_K S ||f||C>0 with equation (C.12) we complete the proof.
