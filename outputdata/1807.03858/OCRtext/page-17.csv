"Proof. We denote py/IX  by p’(y | at) and pYIX  by p(y|m), and let p(m) be a simpliﬁcation
for p We have by Cauchy-Schwarz,"

(D.9)
It follows that
p(m)dmdy — 1 = E [X2(Y|XaYl|X) I X]

"Claim D.6. Let u be a distribution over the state space 8. Let P and P’ be two transition kernels.
G = 22°=owP>k = (Id — 713W and G' = Ziowp'r = (Id — 7133-1. Let d = (1 — wait
and d’ = (1 — 'y)G’/J be the discounted distribution starting from u induced by the transition kernels
G and G’. Then,"

Moreover, let 7(P’ — P) = A. Then, we have

(since (1 — *y)|G’|1_)1 g 1)
"Replacing G’ in the RHS of the equation (D.13) by G’ = G + G’AG, and doing this recursively
gives"

Corollary D.7. Let 7r and 7r’ be two policies and let p7r be deﬁned as in Deﬁnition 2.1. Then,

"Proof. Let P and P’ be the state-state transition matrix under policy 7r and 7r’ and A = 7(P’ — P)
