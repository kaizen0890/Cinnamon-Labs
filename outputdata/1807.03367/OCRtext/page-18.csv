"To account for class imbalance, we train all described models With a binary cross entropy loss
weighted by the inverted class frequency. We create a 80—20 class—conditional split of the dataset into

a training and validation set. We train for 100 epochs and perform early stopping on the validation
loss."
"The F1 scores for the described methods in Table 10. We compare to an “all positive” baseline that
always predicts that the landmark class is visible and observe that all presented models struggle to
outperform this baseline. Although 256—dimensional ResNet features achieve slightly better precision
on the validation set, it results in much worse recall and a lower Fl score. Our results indicate that
perceptual grounding is a difﬁcult task, which easily merits a paper of its own right, and so we leave
further improvements (e. g. better text recognizers) for future work."

"Dataset split We split the full dataset by assigning entire 4X4 grids (independent of the target
location) to the train, valid or test set. Speciﬁcally, we design the split such that the valid set contains
at least one intersection (out of four) is not part of the train set. For the test set, all four intersec-

tions are novel. See our source code, available at https : //github . com/ f acebookresearch/
talkthewalk, for more details on how this split is realized."

Hello, what are you near?

ACTIONzTURNLEFT ACTIONzTURNLEFT ACTIONzTURNLEFT

Hello, in front of me is a Brooks Brothers

ACTIONzTURNLEFT ACTIONzFORWARD ACTIONzTURNLEFT ACTIONzTURNLEFT

Is that a shop or restaurant?

ACTIONzTURNLEFT

It is a clothing shop.

You need to go to the intersection in the northwest corner of the map

There appears to be a bank behind me.

0k, turn left then go straight up that road

There should be shops on two of the corners but you

need to go to the corner without a shop.

let me know when you get there.
