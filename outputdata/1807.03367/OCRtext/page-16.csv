Landmark Classiﬁcation

"While the guide has access to the landmark labels, the tourist needs to recognize these landmarks
from raw perceptual information. In this section, we study landmark classiﬁcation as a supervised
learning problem to investigate the difﬁculty of perceptual grounding in Talk The Walk."
"The Talk The Walk dataset contains a total of 307 different landmarks divided among nine classes,
see Figure 4 for how they are distributed. The class distribution is fairly imbalanced, with shops
and restaurants as the most frequent landmarks and relatively few play ﬁelds and theaters. We treat
landmark recognition as a multi-label classiﬁcation problem as there can be multiple landmarks on a

comer5 ."
"For the task of landmark classiﬁcation, we extract the relevant views of the 360 image from which
a landmark is visible. Because landmarks are labeled to be on a speciﬁc comer of an intersection,
we assume that they are visible from one of the orientations facing away from the intersection. For
example, for a landmark on the northwest comer of an intersection, we extract views from both"
"5Strictly speaking, this is more general than a multi-label setup because a comer might contain multiple
landmarks of the same class."
