Table 8: Samples from the tourist models communicating in natural language.
"Analyzing tourist samples Table 8 shows samples of the trained tourist models, illustrating the
differences between them. First, we observe that the ground-truth human utterance and vanilla
sampling of the supervised model does not always ground the message into the observations. For
example, the human utterance does not mention the bar, neither does the vanilla sample (which
mentions a restaurant). By contrast, greedy and beam-search decoding both produce samples that
mention that they are at the bar (the observed landmark). Also the policy gradient model mentions
the observed landmark, but the generated sample has lost some linguistic structure."

"Figure 2: We show MASC values of two action sequences for tourist localization Via discrete
communication with T = 3 actions. In general, we observe that the ﬁrst action always corresponds
to the correct state—transition, whereas the second and third are sometimes mixed. For instance, in the
top example, the ﬁrst two actions are correctly predicted but the third action is not (as the MASC
corresponds to a “no action”). In the bottom example, the second action appears as the third MASC."
