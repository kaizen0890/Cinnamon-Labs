"The Talk the Walk task and dataset facilitate future research on various important subﬁelds of artiﬁcial
intelligence, including grounded language learning, goal-oriented dialogue research and situated
navigation. Here, we describe related previous work in these areas."
"Related tasks There has been a long line of work involving related tasks. Early work on task-
oriented dialogue dates back to the early 90s with the introduction of the Map Task [1] and Maze
Game [19] corpora. Recent efforts have led to larger— scale goal-oriented dialogue datasets, for instance
to aid research on visually-grounded dialogue [13, 15], knowledge-base-grounded discourse [24]
or negotiation tasks [34]. At the same time, there has been a big push to develop environments for
embodied AI, many of which involve agents following natural language instructions with respect to an
environment[4, 50, 26, 37, 10, 9], following-up on early work in this area [36, 11]. An early example
of navigation using neural networks is [23], who propose an online learning approach for robot
navigation. Recently, there has been increased interest in using end-to-end trainable neural networks
for learning to navigate indoor scenes[22, 21] or large cities [8, 39], but, unlike our work, without
multi-agent communication. Also the task of localization (without multi-agent communication) has
recently been studied in [9]."
"Grounded language learning Grounded language learning is motivated by the observation that
humans leam language embodied (grounded) in sensorimotor experience of the physical world
[6, 44]. On the one hand, work in multi-modal semantics has shown that grounding can lead to
practical improvements on various natural language understanding tasks [see 5, 28, and references
therein]. In robotics, researchers dissatisﬁed with purely symbolic accounts of meaning attempted
to build robotic systems with the aim of grounding meaning in physical experience of the world
[43, 45]. Recently, grounding has also been applied to the learning of sentence representations
[30], image captioning [35, 49], visual question answering [3, l6], visual reasoning [27, 41], and
grounded machine translation [42, 17]. Grounding also plays a crucial role in the emergent research
of multi—agent communication, where, agents communicate (in natural language or otherwise) in
order to solve a task, with respect to their shared environment [33, 14, 40, 18, 34, 46, 32]."
Implementation Details

"For the emergent communication models, we use an embedding size L = 500. The natural language
experiments use 128-dimensional word embeddings and a bidirectional RNN with 256 units. In
all experiments, we train the guide with a cross entropy loss using the ADAM optimizer with
default hyper-parameters [31]. We perform early stopping on the validation accuracy, and report the
corresponding train, valid and test accuracy. We optimize the localization models with continuous,
discrete and natural language communication channels for 200, 200, and 25 epochs, respectively. To
facilitate further research on Talk The Walk, we make our code base for reproducing experiments
publicly available at https : //github . com/ f acebookresearch/t alkthewalk."

Additional Experiments
"First, we investigate localization performance of MASC and no-MASC models for increasing
dialogue context. Next, using bearn—search decoding for generating a single tourist utterance, we
show that localization accuracy deteriorates for increasing beam-size. Lastly, we compare full task
performance of natural language models trained on human and random walk trajectories, ﬁnding that
best performance is attained for random walks with T = 0, i.e. for models conditioned on a single
observation."
"Localization improves with more dialogue context We conduct an ablation study for MASC on
natural language with varying dialogue context. Speciﬁcally, we compare localization accuracy of
MASC and no-MASC models trained on the last [1, 3, 5] utterances of the dialogue (including guide
utterances). We report these results in Table 5. In all cases, MASC outperforms the no—MASC models
by several accuracy points. We also observe that mean predicted if (over the test set) increases from 1
to 2 when more dialogue context is included."
"Increasing beam size lowers performance We report localization performance of tourist utter-
ances generated by beam search decoding of varying beam size in Table 6. We ﬁnd that performance

decreases from 29.05% to 20.87% accuracy on the test set when we increase the beam-size from one
to eight."
