Conclusion
"We introduced the Talk The Walk task and dataset, which consists of crowd-sourced dialogues in
which two human annotators collaborate to navigate to target locations in the virtual streets of NYC.
For the important localization sub-task, we proposed MASC—a novel grounding mechanism to learn
state-transition from the tourist’s message—and showed that it improves localization performance for
emergent and natural language. We believe Talk The Walk is a useful resource for grounded language
learning, and hope it will facilitate research on the intersection of computer Vision, goal-directed
dialogue systems, reinforcement learning, navigation, and planning."
"Acknowledgement We thank Jack Urbanek and Will Feng for their help on integrating Talk The

Walk into ParlAI, and Saizheng Zhang, Florian Strub, and Ethan Perez for their comments on an
early draft of this paper."
