It’s not right.

What should I be on the look for?

ACTIONzTURNRIGHT ACTIONzTURNRIGHT ACTIONzTURNRIGHT

There should be shops on two corners but you need to be on one of the corners
without the shop.

Try the other corner.

this intersection has 2 shop corners and a bank corner

yes. that’s what I see on the map.

should I go to the bank corner? or one of the shop corners?

or the blank corner (perhaps a hotel)

ACTIONzTURNLEFT ACTIONzTURNLEFT ACTIONzTURNRIGHT ACTIONzTURNRIGHT
Go to the one near the hotel. The map says the hotel is a little
further down but it might be a little off.

It’s a big hotel it’s possible.

I’m on the hotel corner
