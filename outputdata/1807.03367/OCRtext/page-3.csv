"actions) before they successfully complete the task. The majority of acts comprise the tourist’s
actions, with on average more than 44 actions per dialogue. The guide produces roughly 9 utterances
per dialogue, slightly more than the tourist’s 8 utterances. Turkers use diverse discourse, with a
vocabulary size of more than 10K. An example from the dataset is shown in Appendix G."

Experiments
"The ﬁnal end-to-end Talk The Walk task is challenging and the full solution is an open problem that
we pose to the community. Here, we focus on studying localization, exploring models with emergent
and natural language communication, and use localization models to provide baselines for the full
task. In order to make headway, in what follows we make the following simplifying assumptions:"
"Perfect Perception Early experiments revealed that perceptual grounding of landmarks is difﬁcult:
we set up a landmark classiﬁcation problem, on which models with extracted CNN [25] or text
recognition features [20] barely outperform a random baseline—see Appendix F for full details. To
ensure that perception is not the limiting factor when investigating localization capabilities of models,
we assume “perfect perception”: in lieu of the 360 image View, the tourist is given the landmarks at
its current location. More formally, each state observation 8”“ now equals the set of landmarks at
the (1:, y)-location, i.e. Sw’y’o = Aw’y. If the (1:, y)-location does not have any visible landmarks, we
return a single “empty comer” symbol."
"Orientation-agnostic tourist We opt to ignore the tourist’s orientation, which simpliﬁes the set
of actions to [Left, Right, Up, Down], corresponding to adding [(-1, 0), (l, 0), (0, l), (0, -l)] to the
current (1:, y) coordinates, respectively. Note that actions are now coupled to an orientation on the
map—e. g. up is equal to going north—and this implicitly assumes that the tourist has access to a
compass. This also affects perception, since the tourist now has access to Views from all orientations:
in conjunction with “perfect perception”, implying that only landmarks at the current comer are given,
whereas landmarks from different comers (e. g. across the street) are not Visible."

Tourist Localization
"Arguably the most important subtask of Talk The Walk is localization: without being able to localize
the tourist, the guide cannot tell if the target location has been reached. Here, we investigate tourist
localization with communication in the form of continuous vectors, discrete symbols and natural
language."
"Emergent language A tourist, starting from a random location, takes T Z 0 random actions
A = {040, . . . ,aT_1} to reach target location (mtgt, ytgt). Every location in the environment has a
corresponding set of landmarks A“; = {10, . . . , 1K} for each of the (1:, y) coordinates. As the tourist
navigates, the agent perceives T + 1 state-observations Z = {(0, . . . ,(T} where each observation (t
consists of a set of K landmark symbols {13, . . . ,l’g}. Given the observations Z and actions A, the
tourist generates a message M which is communicated to the other agent. The objective of the guide
is to predict the location (mtgt, ytgt) from the tourist’s message M."
"Natural language In contrast to our emergent communication experiments, we do not take random
actions but instead extract actions, observations, and messages from the dataset. Speciﬁcally, we
consider each tourist utterance (i.e. at any point in the dialogue), obtain the current tourist location
as target location (1:, y)tgt, the utterance itself as message M, and the sequence of observations and
actions that took place between the current and previous tourist utterance as Z and A, respectively.
Similar to the emergent language setting, the guide’s objective is to predict the target location (1:, y)tgt
models from the tourist message M. We conduct experiments with M taken from the dataset and
with M generated from the extracted observations Z and actions A."
3.2
Full Task
"We establish baselines for the full navigation task by letting trained localization models undertake
random walks, using the following protocol: at each step, the tourist connnunicates its observations
to the guide, who predicts the tourist’s location. If the guide predicts that the tourist is at target, we
evaluate its location. If successful, the task ends, otherwise we continue until there have been three
wrong evaluations. The protocol is given as pseudo-code in Appendix E."
