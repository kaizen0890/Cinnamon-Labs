Figure 5: Left: the simulation. Right: the density map.
"The left image of figure 5 is the simulation of the model. Agents start from the elevator lobby
at the bottom-left of the ﬂoor. The black color objects in the map indicate the structure (e. g.
walls and columns) of the building. The red color ones indicate Windows and light courts. The
green and blue color ones indicate the exhibits and the agents."
"There are several parameters in the simulator. If the total number of agents in the floor is
smaller than 30, the simulator adds 1 to 10 agents randomly and iteratively after a constant
time span. The model randomly assigns the threshold between 10 and 20 pixels to define
whether the agent is near or far away from its target. The model also randomly assigns values
to P1, P2, and Al to simulate different human characteristics. The lower and upper bounds of P1
and P2 are 0.5 and l. The lower and upper bounds of Al is 1/7000 and 1/500. In the modified

weighted A* search algorithm, the weight used is 10. The variance of the random noise added
in the heuristic function is 1000."
"The right image of figure 5 is the density map which shows how likely that an agent will occur
in the location. The brighter the pixel, the higher the probability. After an amount of time, the
map converges. Density map is an important evaluation of the ﬂoorplan. For instance, in figure
6, the left-most image shows that the density on the boundaries facing the entrance is higher.
The architect might need to increase the size of these openings. The left-middle image
illustrates that the density in the gallery near the entrance is higher. The size of the gallery
might need to be increased. In the right-middle image, there are a lot of paths inside the red
box. The architect can design a resting area here for people walking by. The right-most image
indicates the way to increase the user experience. Placing eye-catching exhibits at some
locations can strengthen the connectivity between small galleries."
