"Third, how does human plan paths to their targets and react when they are about to collide
with others? Some people have maps in their hands or have visited the space before. So they
know where exactly the targets are. While some people explores the space based on their
intuition. The model needs to present a planning algorithm and collision prediction mechanism.
Mukai et al. [3] developed a dynamic path setting for avoiding collision. Stipanovic et al. [5]
presented a collision avoidance function for robotic control. Yang et al. [7] used a neural
network inspired by biology for dynamic collision-free path planning."
"This paper presents a human moving path simulator for a museum exhibition space. It is a
multi-agent system which takes a series of preprocessed ﬂoorplans as inputs, simulates
moving paths as time goes on, and outputs an evaluation map for architecture design. The
simulator uses a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to build the human behavior model. The
states and actions in the MDP represent mental states (e. g. attracted by objects, boring...etc.)
and actions (e.g. stay, move to a certain direction... etc.). The model assigns different
transition probabilities to represent human characteristics. Some actions uses a modified
weighted A* search algorithm for human path planning."

"The ﬂoorplan is the 5th gallery of Sendai Mediatheque, Sendai city, Japan by Toyo Ito Architect.
It is first down-sampled to 320 by 320 pixels. Each 1 by 1 pixel corresponds to about 7 by 7
square centimeters in the real space. Then 6 images are generated by assigning different colors
to basic elements in the space, as shown in figure 1. There are 3 images for visible elements,
2 images for invisible elements, and 1 image for rendering. The 3 visible elements are
“window”, “structure”, and “exhibit”. They represent glasses and light courts which are
visually permeable, walls and columns which cannot be seen through, and art works. The 2
invisible elements are “region” and “boundary”, the area and the boundary (e. g. gates, doors,
openings... etc.) of a particular small gallery. The “ﬂoorplan” image combines 3 visible
elements. The simulator takes all 6 images as inputs. The starting and leaving point is at the
elevator lobby on the bottom-left of the ﬂoorplan."
