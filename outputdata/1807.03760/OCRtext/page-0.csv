Abstract
"Human moving path is an important feature in architecture design. By
studying the path, architects know where to arrange the basic elements (e. g.
structures, glasses, furniture... etc.) in the space. This paper presents
SimArch, a multi-agent system for human moving path simulation. It
involves a behavior model built by using a Markov Decision Process. The
model simulates human mental states, target range detection, and collision
prediction when agents are on the ﬂoor, in a particular small gallery, looking
at an exhibit, or leaving the ﬂoor. It also models different kinds of human
characteristics by assigning different transition probabilities. A modified
weighted A* search algorithm quickly plans the sub-optimal path of the
agents. In an experiment, SimArch takes a series of preprocessed ﬂoorplans
as inputs, simulates the moving path, and outputs a density map for
evaluation. The density map provides the prediction that how likely a person
will occur in a location. A following discussion illustrates how architects can
use the density map to improve their ﬂoorplan design."
Introduction

"Can machines design or help human design? When an architect designs a building, human
moving path is an important feature that he needs to consider. The path affects the basic
elements (e.g. walls, columns, windows, furniture, stairs... etc.) placed in the building.
Architects usually rely on their past experiences in visiting or designing the type of building
to determine the possible human moving paths. But what if the architect doesn’t have enough
experiences? This paper focuses on the problem that how machines provide reasonable
predictions and evaluations based on human behavior models."
"There are several sub-problems. The first one is how to come up with a reasonable human
behavior model. Human behaviors can be simplified to decision making processes. People
make decisions every day in daily lives. They take actions according to current states. And
their current states are determined by last states and actions. Ziebart et al. [8] used a soft-
maximum Markov Decision Process with inverse reinforcement learning (maximum entropy
inverse optimal control) to predict the decision uncertainty of pedestrians."
"Second, how can the model represent human characteristics? There are a lot of different types
of people. Some people like to wander around in the space while others like to look at their
targets in detail. The model needs to represent the uncertainty of human characteristics.
Therakomen [6] discussed the human steering behavior and used a geometry-based path
planning algorithm to model wandering, passing-through, and obstacle avoiding behaviors."
