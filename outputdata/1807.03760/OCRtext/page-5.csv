Discussion and Future Work

"There are several problems and possible improvements of this model. First, the model doesn’t
involve the human characteristics in figure 7. Some people prefer walking to and stay in quiet
spaces while others prefer crowd spaces. Some people love following other people while
others doesn’t. Some people like exploring the space and walk toward the target in their vision
fields while others like to look at maps."

Figure 7: More human characteristics.
"Second, there is a bug in the model for collision prediction. When an agent tries to move
toward the target and figures out that it will collide with another one, the agent will wait at the
same location until safe. The bug is that two agents will halt when they are waiting for each
other. The model needs a better collision prediction mechanism and an algorithm that can
repair the planning path dynamically (e. g. anytime repairing A* search [2]). But in fact, the
bug seldom shows up in the simulation because of the random noise added in the heuristic
function."
"Third, in architecture design, architects are not only interested in simulating one floorplan but
also the entire building. The model now only considers the horizontal relationship (floorplan)
in the building. In real situation, vertical relationships (elevation) also affect human moving
paths. For instance, a space (e. g. a high-ceiling atrium) that has a broader view of multiple

ﬂoors is more likely to attract people."
Conclusion

"This paper presents a human moving path simulator, SimArch, for architecture design.
SimArch uses a Markov Decision Process as the behavior model. The model involves human
mental states, target range detection, and collision prediction. It also models different human
characteristics by assigning different transition probabilities. A modified weighted A* search
algorithm quickly computes the sub-optimal moving path. SimArch takes a series of
preprocessed gallery ﬂoorplans as inputs, uses the behavior model for simulation, and outputs
a density map for evaluation Which helps architects to improve the ﬂoorplan design."
