"This section goes back over the concepts of fuzzy nominal scale and metrical scale
presented in [Benoit and Foulloy 2013] that are used to represent postures. A
fuzzy nominal scale is deﬁned as the link between a quantity manifestation and its
representation by a fuzzy subset of linguistic terms also called Lexical Fuzzy Sub-
set and denoted LFS in this paper. It gives a formal framework to the fuzzy map-
ping process presented in [Mauris et al. 1994; Benoit and Foulloy 2002]. Its has
been already shown that the fuzzy nominal scales map an equality relation on lex-
ical term to a fuzzy similarity on LFSs. In [De Baets and Mesiar 2002], De Baets
and Mesiar presented multiple possible fuzzy relations that can be used to extend
the concept of fuzzy nominal scales. We especially point out the introduction of a
new distance between LFSs in [Allevard et al. 2007]. This distance, called trans-
portation distance and inspired by the Earth Mover Distance in [Rubner et al.
2000], is linked with an arbitrary predefined distance between lexical terms and
extends it by the way of a metrical scale as presented in [Benoit and Foulloy
2013].

Let ds be an arbitrary defined distance between lexical terms. This distance re-
ﬂect a knowledge related to the semantic of the lexical terms. It can be experimen-
tally deﬁned using a calibration process. Another way is to use this distance to
include an knowledge on the relation between lexical terms. For example, the dis-
tance between two terms representing similar entities is arbitrarily defined as
small. The transportation distance d's between LFSs is then deduced from ds such
that the coincidence on singletons is respected.

Working with a metrical scale gives much more possibilities than working with
a nominal scale even if this one is a fuzzy nominal scale. Indeed the fuzzy nominal
scale preserves only the similarity during the measurement: if 2 entities are similar
then their representations (as LFSs) throw a fuzzy nominal scale are similar. A
metrical scale preserves also the comparisons of distances between entities. This
means that the distance comparison can be used on the set of LFSs.

In this paper, we propose to transpose the concept of tolerance interval to the
set of LFSs. The chosen solution to implement this is to create a tolerance vol-
umes deﬁned with the transportation distance.

Fuzzy scale provides a tool to represent a posture with an LFS, but gives no
semantic to the membership degree of each term to this fuzzy subset. In this study,
we decided to choose a weak semantic by the interpretation of the fuzzy member-
ship degrees as belief masses as defined in the TBM (Transferable Belief Model)
[Smets 2000]. According to this semantic, each LFS is termed as Basic Belief As-
signment i.e. the membership degree of a LFS is interpreted as a unitary mass dis-
tributed on the singletons."
