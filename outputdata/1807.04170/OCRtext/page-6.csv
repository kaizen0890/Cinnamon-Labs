"postures. Each modal posture is known by a word in the system. Reference pos-
tures can be expressed in terms of mass on known modal postures. The mass crite-
rion is computed from the reference posture and each known modal posture.
Hence, a reference posture Prefis written as:"
Pref: (LP-mad], LP-mad, 2, LP-maaﬂ3, . . . , 1413411051,”)
(4)
"where n is the (maximum) number of modal postures (contained in Lp.mgd).
Note that terms associated with no-neighbor modal postures, if they appear, are set

to 0.
