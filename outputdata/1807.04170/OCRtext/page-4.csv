"arm is level in front of the human's body. The LFS of a-iheia is {down, horizon,
up} and the LFS of a-psi angle is {rean outside, front, inside}. Fig. 2 illustrates
the a-iheia and a-psi angle lexical posture determination from respective angle
measurements. In this step, we present the concept of modal angle values that de-
ﬁne representative angles. A modal angle is deﬁned such that the LFS obtained by
the fuzzy linguistic description is a singleton."

Fig. 2 Sub-lexical for arm posture from the a—theta angle value and the a—psi angle value.
"Then, the arm posture is represented by the combination of these 2 lexical sub-
sets, corresponding to the 2 a-tehta and a-psi angles.
The arm corresponding variable takes its values in the lexical set Lam, (l):"
Lam, = {down front, up, outside, rear, inside}

"2) Forearm modeling

A similar process of arm modeling is done for the forearm part. 2 angles are
used: f-tetha which corresponds to the angle formed by the forearm axis and arm
axis and f-psi, which corresponds to the position relative to the horizon. The fuzzi-
f1cation process is the same as the arm part and is not detailed in this paper. The
forearm corresponding variable takes its values in the lexical set Lfmarm (2):"
Lfmarm = {0pm, vclose, hclose, vmiddle, hmiddle}
