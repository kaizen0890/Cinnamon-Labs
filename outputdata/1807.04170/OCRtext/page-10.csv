"It would be worth studying the impact quality of the recognition process using
modal information (i.e. posture) as reference. Indeed, on the one hand, not using
additional reference representations simplifies the system but the learning step is
dependent on the amount of known information (postures) to be detected. On the
other hand, representing reference information (postures) to be detected facilitates
adding new reference information. But ﬁxed modal postures have to be chosen in
order for the system to be able to represent new references."
