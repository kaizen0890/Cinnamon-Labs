"these is communication through postures that can be described with words. Fig. 1
(left) illustrates the posture ""hello"" in a 2D representation of the body detected by
the depth sensor and the measured joints. This particularity of postures makes it
possible to describe them with fuzzy nominal scales.

The depth camera sensor (the Asus Xtion Pro Live) produces posture detection
using NiTE library. The result of this process is a set of 3D joint positions that we
call the measured skeleton.

We illustrate our approach with a right upper limb detection posture. To ex-
press the human posture representation, we decompose arm and forearm represen-
tation into 2 corresponding intermediate high-level representations which are ex-
pressed using words. Human posture and high-level representations of arm and
forearm measurement are linked by rules as shown below.

Each body part (i.e. the arm and forearm) are expressed using words. The an-
gles pertaining to the arm and forearm are computed from the joint positions of the
detected skeleton. Lexical sets are chosen to have simple and easily understanda-
ble descriptions. Each part (i.e. the arm and forearm) is characterized by the 2
measured angles from the position of the joints, as illustrated in ﬁg. 1. We also use
lexical fuzzy subsets as shown below.

In this section, we present arm forearm modeling from respective angles meas-
urement of skeleton. LFS are used. Arm and forearm posture definition rules are
detailed. Then, right limb modeling is detailed using LFS too and corresponding
rules are detailed too."

"1) Arm modeling

For arm angle measurement, we use a-tetha angle and a-psi angle. The a-tetha
angle corresponds to the angle formed from the vertical to the arm, in the plane of
the human body. a-psi is the angle formed from the vertical to the arm when the"
