"ence postures and on the distance that characterizes the tolerance volume. Case 4
illustrates this situation: set {Pregb Prem} is chosen as the partial decision.

Another constraint is added in order to perform the decision. The nature of the
robot's action associated to the command posture is able to inﬂuence the decision
process. To illustrate this, we consider two classes of actions (each corresponding
to a reference posture): one class contains ""classical"" actions and the second
""emergency"" actions, corresponding respectively to a ""classical"" reference posture
and an ""emergency"" reference posture. So when an ""emergency"" reference posture
is detected even with a lower mass than a classical detected reference posture, the
selected decision is the corresponding ""emergency"" action. From this considera-
tion, either the nearest emergency reference posture is selected — see case 5 of fig.
4; or the consumer constraint reduces the set of possible recognized postures to the
emergency related one. This situation is similar to case 2 approach, but with corre-
sponding emergency postures only."

"Let's look at an applicative example on posture recognition: 3 reference pos-
tures named pointing, standing and protect are performed and measured, then
translated into LFSs on LPWWI. Ppmmg, Pslandmg and Ppmm to denote the 3 refer-
ence postures. These are illustrated in ﬁg 7. A d5 distance is deﬁned on the lexical
set of modal postures medaz . This distance is arbitrarily chosen in order to re-
spect some constraints:

The larger distance between 2 modal terms is arbitrarily fixed to 3.0.
The smaller distance between 2 modal terms related to the same elbow
angle, therefore only related to the different shoulder angles, is ﬁxed to
1.0.

E' The smaller distance between 2 modal terms related to the same shoulder
angle, therefore only related to the different elbow angles, is ﬁxed to 0.5.

Then d5 is extended to a dig distance on the LFSs on medaz, as presented in 2.1.
First the distance between reference postures is computed:

dIS(Pp0inlmg, Pslandmg) : 

,S(Ppamling, Ppralecl) : 

dIS(Pslanding, Ppralecl) : 

As expected the pointing and standing postures are closer to each other than to
the protect posture. A new P1 posture to be recognized is acquired then fuzziﬁed
to produce an LFS. In this example, we take a stop posture (see fig. 6)."
