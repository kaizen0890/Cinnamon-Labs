"3) Right upper limb modeling

The posture is represented by the combination of an arm and a forearm posture
and is also defined by words. Each word represents a human modal posture. Each
modal posture of the right upper limb corresponds to a set of modal postures of
each part of the limb.

The lexical set of postures is defined by a list of modal postures LP.mgd (table 2).

Using rules, each modal posture made by upper limb postures is deﬁned in the
system. This learning step is based on the sub-posture entries: the arm and forearm
values. Table 2 illustrates rules deﬁning modal postures from lexical subsets de-
fined in (l) and (2).

It is noted that the example in table 2 illustrates a 2D dimension case due to the

2 linguistic variables (corresponding to the arm and forearm). It is possible to
generate the principle to n dimensions."
The linguistic set of modal postures is given in (3):

"The set of all modal postures LP—mad can be directly the set of reference postures
i.e. known postures to be detected. This particular situation is presented in [Perrin
et al. 2015]. In this paper, reference postures are expressed from modal postures.
This additional step allows for the application designer to distinguish modal pos-
tures from reference postures. Therefore, modal posture definition rules (table 2)
are fixed independently from reference postures. In the next sub-section, reference
posture modeling is presented based on modal posture representation."
2.3 Human reference posture representation
"Reference postures are the postures to be detected and are known by the system
during the learning process. This section presents their representation from modal"
