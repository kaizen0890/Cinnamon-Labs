"Abstract. Human posture recognition provides a dynamic field that has produced
many methods. Using fuzzy subsets based data fusion methods to aggregate the
results given by different types of recognition processes is a convenient way to
improve recognition methods. Nevertheless, choosing a defuzziﬁcation method to
implement the decision is a crucial point of this approach. The goal of this paper is
to present an approach where the choice of the defuzzification method is driven by
the constraints of the final data user, which are expressed as limitations on indica-
tors like conﬁdence or accuracy. A practical experimentation illustrating this ap-
proach is presented: from a depth camera sensor, human posture is interpreted and
the defuzzification method is selected in accordance with the constraints of the
ﬁnal information consumer. The paper illustrates the interest of the approach in a
context of postures based human robot communication."
1 Introduction
"Human posture recognition provides a dynamic field that has produced many
methods [Mitra and Acharya 2007] that commonly perform a measurement pro-
cess in order to convert the physical state of an entity into an information entity.
Although numerical values are commonly used to represent measurement results,
it is now admitted that some applications manipulate symbolic values or linguistic
terms better.

In this paper, we concentrate first on recognizing human posture from upper
limb posture detection. The two parts (arm and forearm) are expressed using lin-
guistic terms. The corresponding symbolic values result from numeric angle
measurements of the human body provided by a depth camera sensor, in our case
an Asus Xtion Pro Live. We also use linguistic terms to express postures from
symbolic values of the upper limb parts.

Then we focus on the decision process performed from the symbolic values,
which are commonly expressed in terms of mass. Fusion methods are particularly"
