"The strategies for the decision are as follows:
E' The closest reference posture: this strategy is not recommended when the
set of reference postures is small.
E' Non overlapping tolerance volumes: we deﬁne a tolerance distance for
each reference posture:
dtolerancepamlmg = 0.07
dtolerancesmndmg = 0.05
dtolerancepmlecl = 0.5
E' Possible overlapping tolerance volumes, and the protect posture is consi-
dered as critical.
dtolerancepamlmg = 0.10
dtolerancesmndmg = 0.08
dtolerancepmlecl = 1.0
The P1 distances to the references are computed.
’5(P1,Pp0m,mg) = 1.8475, d’S(P1,Psmdmg) = 1.9005, d'S(P1,Ppmlecl) = 0.584
In this case, the final decision depends on the chosen strategy. The last one re-
cognizes the protect posture even if the measured one is not so close. With the
second strategy, no posture is recognized.

4 Perspectives
"In the future our work will consider several posture recognition sensors and
types of sensors. This will illustrate the interest of the multi-modal fusion ap-
proach which will make it possible to manage conﬂicting infonnation. In addition,
we will look into how to consider human gesture and its repetition from a tem-
poral point of View, which will also allow us to study how fast it is done."
