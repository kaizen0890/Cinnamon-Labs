"effective here and are used to manipulate mass [Dubois and Prad 1988]. They are
generally used in the decision system as they can formalize decision criteria from
fuzzy information, especially when evidence theory is used. Finally, we propose to
express the needs of the information consumer, which are viewed as constraints on
the decision process. This allows to choose and compute the decision, i.e. action to
be done, in accordance with the consumer's needs and use.

Posture recognition carried out by a human is complex and the decision process
takes into consideration criteria like hesitation between known postures or belief
in a recognition posture. Fuzzy logic facilitates the manipulation of these con-
cepts. In the case of automatic and artificial processes for human posture recogni-
tion, we show that results of fusion methods associated to the evidence theory are
a good way to express consumer criteria, which are finally used to select the de-
fuzzification method.

This approach, illustrated in section 4, is used to give orders to a humanoid
NAO robot developed by the Aldebaran Company, from human posture recogni-
tion. The system learns a set of reference postures, each one corresponding to an
order chosen to be transmitted to the robot. For example: the user wants the robot
to execute an order only if the recognition of the corresponding human posture is
sure, i.e. with low uncertainty or not ambiguous with other possible reference pos-
tures. Another example: a posture corresponds to an emergency action. In this
case, if this posture is recognized with enough certainty, the corresponding order
is chosen even if another posture is recognized at the same time, but with a greater
certainty.

In section 2, we present posture modeling using fuzzy representation. Section 3
details the posture recognition process.

In section 4 the decision process is described using distance criteria from leam—
ing reference postures. This approach allows for deﬁning and formalizing user
constraints like recognition quality or threshold distance of posture detection. Fa-
cilitating the decision process based on mass transfers inside fuzzy representation
of human posture is introduced.

User constraints are thrown back to the decision system which is now able to
choose the robot order to be applied, in accordance to user expectation."
2 Fuzzy logic for human posture modeling
"This section goes back over the concepts of fuzzy nominal scale and metrical scale
presented in [Benoit and Foulloy 2013] that are used to represent postures."
