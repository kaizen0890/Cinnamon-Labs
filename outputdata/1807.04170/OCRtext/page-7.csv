3 Decision process under user constraints
"In our application context, the decision process has to choose an action from a
human posture recognition result, which is expressed using fuzzy representation.
This allows us to express the detection finely: several postures can be detected
from one human posture. At the end of the configuration process, posture
knowledge is made up of a lexical set, and a set of reference postures. Each refer-
ence posture is defined by a fuzzy subset interpreted as a mass distribution on the
lexical set [Benoit et al. 2015; Allevard et al. 2005]. A measurement result is also
defined as represented by a fuzzy subset interpreted as another mass distribution
on the same lexical set. The decision process then acts as a defuzzification.

This ﬂuency of information carried by fuzzy representation is conventionally
employed cases using multi-sensor detection. In this paper, we focus on its inter-
ests in order to automatize the choice of action to be done from one human posture
recognition. The imprecision carries information that represents possible confu-
sion, hesitation or belief of detected postures. The output of the decision process
stems from the defuzziﬁcation process.

Several reference postures are detected from one human posture detection. In
this experiment context, we consider that each reference posture corresponds to an
action to be executed by the NAG robot. For each reference posture LP_refi is a
corresponding action named A.

In our first basic approach, the decision is given by the closest reference pos-
ture obtained by the computation of the transportation distance on the LFS space,
as presented in section II.A., between the measured posture Pdem and the refer-
ence postures. This is the case in case 1 (fig. 4) where the decision result is a non-
empty set of reference postures.

Our second approach considers the uncertainty of the measurement process
predominantly coming from camera process detection. The uncertainty estimation
is complex in this case and is not presented in this paper. In all cases, epistemic
uncertainty, i.e. relative to posture deﬁnition, is more important and taken into
account by the consumer. We consider that the consumer accepts a tolerance vol-
ume around each reference posture on the LFS space, as illustrated in ﬁg. 4. This
tolerance volume plays the same role for the LFS space as the tolerance interval
for numerical spaces. It is defined by the distance between a measured posture and
the reference posture, which is recognized for having the measured posture inside
its tolerance volume. In case 2 presented in ﬁg. 4, the measured posture is outside
the tolerance volumes of all reference postures and the decision result is an empty
set. In case 3 the tolerance volume around Prefj is large enough to include the
measured posture. In this approach the tolerance volumes do not overlap, so the
decision result is an empty set or a singleton.

In our third approach, the consumer wants to take into account the possible
confusion between several possible postures, which is given by the overlapping of
their respective tolerance volume that depends on the distance between the refer-"
